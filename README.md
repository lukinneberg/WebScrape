# WebScrape

The code in this file scrapes data from a realtor site. Users enter a link and House characteristics,
previous sale information, and tax history will be scraped, cleaned, and exported to a CSV.

Included as well is a Tableau Prep file that allows users to create cleaned data sources for Tableau/PowerBI by exporting the joined data into additional CSV's.

The PDF contains a snippet of an example dashboard that takes a look at housing data mined from Minneapolis/Suburbs for houses in the 100-200k range. 

1. The geographical map shows each individual house listed for sale and the color corresponds to the listing price(pink is in the lower 100k range to a darker green circle nearing the 200k range).

2. Thebar graph shows the average tax information of each property compiled for the last 5 years and compares between each suburb.

3. The line graph shows the average square footage one would expect to recieve in each suburn when buying a house in the 100 - 200k range.
